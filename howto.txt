# How to publish this project to GitHub Pages

1. Ensure the repository is pushed to GitHub:
   - This project assumes the remote repository is: https://github.com/3hreeman/threeman_home
   - If you haven't created it yet, go to GitHub and create a public repository named 'threeman_home'.

2. Configure GitHub Pages:
   - Go to your repository settings on GitHub: https://github.com/3hreeman/threeman_home/settings
   - Click on the "Pages" section in the left sidebar.
   - Under "Build and deployment" > "Source", select "Deploy from a branch".
   - Under "Branch", select "main" (or "master") and the folder "/ (root)".
   - Click "Save".

3. Verify:
   - After a minute or two, refresh the Pages settings.
   - You should see a message saying "Your site is live at..." followed by the URL (usually https://3hreeman.github.io/threeman_home/).
